# CC-DefaulterPrediction
Credit Card Defaulter Prediction using various classification models and regression models 

# Introduction
This project is about finding whether customer will default in his credit card payment. Credit card default is an all-time high in any county. While it is possible that such defaults are deliberate often, they can be completely unintentional. Such defaults can lead to increased interest rate, loss of credit card limit, and reduction in interest free period. This dataset contains information on default payments, demographic factors, credit data, history of payment, and bill statements of credit card clients in Taiwan from April 2005 to September 2005. We apply various Machine Learning algorithms on the dataset and tried to understand factors which contributes to default payment. We expect to gain a deeper understanding regarding factors which influences whether a person pays credit card due in time. From this project banks can get an insight about why certain customers tend to default on credit card payment. Such analysis will be beneficial not only for identifying defaulters but also for targeting customers for other marketing campaigns of the bank.

# Data
The main source of the data is UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. Our study took payment data in October 2005, from an important bank (a cash and credit card issuer) and the targets were credit card holders of the bank. Among the total 25,000 observations, 5529 observations (22.12%) are the cardholders with default payment. This research employed a binary variable â€“ default payment (Yes = 1, No = 0), as the response variable and used the following 23 variables as explanatory variables.
